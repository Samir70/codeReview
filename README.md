# codeReview
I learn best by solving problems. I practise at places like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/samir70/) and [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Samir70). Over the months and yearsI have gradually improved, but lately I am finding that I have started to forget what I have done before. I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to schedule revision, but I find that typing in the code is too time consuming.

Then I heard about Parson's Problems, where you recreate code by putting prewritten lines in order. I did a bit of googling and found some examples and a bit of science to say that it is a good way to practise. I don't think that this will be a good way to learn new code, but I think that it might be a good way to review code I have already written.

I did find a couple of githubs where others have done something similar, but none of them seemed easy to add new material. So here's my version.

I think main problem is that when the codebase grows, then the loading time will end up slow because there is a lot of importing. I will look into an alternative. I have built an API before, including with a database. But I just wanted to get the project up and running.

## Use by others
People are welcome to fork this and add their own code to their own forks. As I said above: I don't think using my examples would be the best way to learn -- even if my code was some kind of model answer, which it rarely will be! Solve problems on the above sites for yourself, and add code for the topics where you learnt something.

In anticiapation that others will get involved, I have included an author property for the object that gets listed in qList. I have also put a language property since that could be a useful way to search through code, too. 

## interface
Still under construction, but my aim is to use this rather than make it pretty.
I have used Vue, GSAP and draggable. I may add a database in the future.
